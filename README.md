- ðŸ‘‹ Hi,My name is Hananel.
At the age of 35 I have 9 children and I work as a manager of team of 12 developers, at a 5000 workers Israeli insurance company called Migdal. 
I also developed a software product which make test automation for Salesforce customers, my product is in check now by couple of global companies. 
I like my job, and absolutly love my family.
But somewhere inside, my heart is broken. why ? 
Because today, in both my job and my startup - I use my knowledge to help people which make a lot of money to make more money. It broke me because as a Jew I believe that God created us to help each other. 
I see all the evil in this world and my heart is broken.
I see poor people, lonely and sad people and my heart is broken.
I see people which suffered abuse and shaming, people who hate each other for no reason.
people who spent a huge amount of money to buy a weapons, whereas with this money we was able to feed the whole world population.
Ok. Not a big deal till now - a lot of people feel like me I believe.
But I have a plan for a 3 projects which I believe can gradually can change this situation a little bit, maybe more than that...
1.Help Me - a platform which will be dedicated to connect between people which need help to people who need help. The platform will also create a social profile for the volunteers. The platform will use Artificial Intelligence to send efficiently help requests to potential helpers - accrding to age, profession, availablity times, if you have a car etc.
** This platform was declared as a 'genius idea' by a man who was one of the founders of an Israeli website called Yad2(similar concept to Ebay), it was sold recently for ~250M$
2.My friend - A platform which will be an AI like Alexa of Amanzon, and will act as a virtual friend. it will encourage you, listen to you, try to make you happier if you are sad, and the most important - will know to recognize if you have a mental problem and offer a professional/supportive commuity assistance, and at a SOS cases like a suicide mission - will alert professionals immediately.
This platform was recommended by Dr. Israel Levitz, a very highly experinced psychlogyst, and author, who have an istitute of ~65 psichologysts working at his insitute.  
3.Polymath - A platform which will connect between retired people who have a lot of knowledge, life experience and connections to people which will need this consultuncy. The fact that retired people made a strong shift from being super productvie to do nothing  justifies the probability of this idea.
How could you help? 
1.Share/Comment/Like so it will be spread to relevant people.
2.Donate your time - if you have relevant knowledge which can help, for Developers I created 3 open source projects at Github. 
3.Donate money - with money I can hire professional people that will help al this staff happen.
I think each one of this Ideas should need an initial investment of plus minus 20K hours of professionals - Product managers, developers, psychologists etc.
